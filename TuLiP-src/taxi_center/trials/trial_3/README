"full" controlled by strategy. 
"full" env_input in dispatcher.

No counter. "full" = 1.

# passenger = 1
# req = 3
# car = 4

ready signal both included.

dispatcher_3: ** states (just grow it to more cars.)
strategy: 33 states
both in gr1c

specs for "full" both controlled by dispatcher and strategy. dispatcher_1,2. abandoned: until find a way such that the lower level can correctly provide car_0_success. Probably not worth it.
