No counter. "full" = 2. specs for "full" controlled by strategy.

"full" env_input in dispatcher. minimal partial transition and []<> on "full"

# passenger = 2
# req = 3
# car = 2

ready signal both included.

dispatcher: 258 states
strategy: 567 states
both in gr1c.

dispatcher: 378 states
strategy: 1067 states
both in jtlv.


PS. there are two ways to write specifications in dispatcher.

either: 
req -> <> (car_0 || car_1)    (currently used)

or:
!car_0_full & !car_1_full & req -> car_0 && !car_1
car_0_full & req -> car_1_full || car_1   (currently used)
