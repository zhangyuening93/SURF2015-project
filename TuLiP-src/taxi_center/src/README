This is the special case for the taxi center problem with 3 possible requests, 2 taxis and 2 passengers on the taxi being full.

The specs for src is hard to generalize. For general version, please check general folder.

The controllers generated by these files were used by the older version of my ROS program, but unfortunately at that time I was unfamiliar with ROS and the code was redundant. Up to now, some details have changed (such as the initial condition for user input), so I would not recommend using these files again.

PLEASE look at the general folder.
