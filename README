Simple taxi problem:
Use TuLiP to generate strategic planner.
Import the controller into matlab.
Integrate with BluSTL program to run the simulation.

Taxi center problem:
Use TuLiP to generate strategic planner.
Use BluSTL to generate navigational planner in real time of simulation.
Use ROS for writing each controller as nodes that talk to each other.
